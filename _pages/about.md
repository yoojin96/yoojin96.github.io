I am passionate about delivering patient-centered care, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, and supporting patients and their families through both acute and long-term care needs. I am committed to continuing my growth in oncology nursing and palliative care. I recently relocated to the United States and am preparing for oncology RN roles here.
